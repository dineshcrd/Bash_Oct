# variables in bash scripting
# This is a very important concept in any programming language or any technology
# Without this, it quite tough to see the quality of the code or the script
# variables are used to store some data and use it when ever required
# a=100
# In bash, There is no concept of data types
# In programming languages like C,c++,Java,Python,Etc.. we have different data types like int, float, double, char, string etc
# But in bash, everything is treated as a string

#Syntax to declare a variable in bash
# variable_name=value
#how to print this? Special character $ is used to access the value of the variable
# echo $variable_name

name="DevSecOps"
echo "Welcome to $name"
